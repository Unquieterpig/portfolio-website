        <p class="lead mb-4">
          For my corpus analysis I chose the scripts of the Star Wars movies. I
          knew that each movie had a different director and writer, so I wanted
          to see if I could find any patterns in the scripts. I am going to
          break up the corpuses into the first 4 movies and the last 3 movies.

          What scripts did I use for the corpus and how did I obtain them?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          I am using the scripts from the first 7 Star Wars movies. I obtained
          them from The Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb). I copied and
          pasted the scripts into a text file.

          I began my analysis on specific character's and their growth through

        <p>
          In Episode 1, Throughout the film, Anakin's dialogue and actions
          showcase his kind-hearted nature, his desire to help others, and his
          longing for freedom. He forms a close bond with Padmé Amidala, the
          young queen of Naboo, and expresses his dream of becoming a Jedi to
          free slaves like himself. Anakin's innocence and inherent goodness are
          contrasted with subtle hints of his future turn to the dark side. His
          fear of losing his mother, his anger towards those who threaten his
          loved ones, and his quick attachment to Padmé all lay the groundwork
          for his eventual fall.

          <p>
            Here are a few examples of Anakin's issues with attachment that are
            the building blocks for his eventual turn to the dark side.

          class="img-fluid"
        />
        <p>
          In Episode 2, Anakin's dialogue portrays him as a confident, yet
          impulsive Padawan. He often expresses his frustrations with Obi-Wan's
          mentorship and his desire to prove himself. For example, when Obi-Wan
          tells him, "You will be a Jedi. I promise," Anakin responds, "I am a
          slow learner." This exchange highlights Anakin's impatience and his
          struggle to find his place within the Jedi Order.
        </p>

            class="img-fluid"
          />
          <p>
            This is a WordCloud of the most used words throughout episode 1-4.
            It is quite evident that Anakin was the most used in episode 1-3,
            and you can see Luke creep up for episode 4.

          class="img-fluid"
        />
        <p>
          In Episode 3, Anakin's dialogue shifts to reflect his growth as a Jedi
          Knight and his internal conflicts. He grapples with his loyalty to the
          Jedi and his growing mistrust of the Council. This is evident when he
          says, "I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more, and I know I
          shouldn't." His conversations with Padmé also reveal his deep-seated
          fear of losing her, foreshadowing his eventual turn to the dark side.
        </p>
        <img

          class="img-fluid"
        />
        <p>
          By Episode 4, Anakin has fully transformed into Darth Vader. His
          dialogue is marked by a cold, authoritative tone, reflecting his
          position as the Emperor's enforcer. When addressing Princess Leia, he
          threatens, "I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you."
          This stark contrast to his earlier dialogue showcases his complete
          embrace of the dark side.

        <h2>Episodes Five and Onwards!</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The next analysis I did was from episode 5-7. I wanted to get the
          newer movies aswell, however their scripts haven't been made avaliable
          as of April 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, I didn't have a clue on what to analyze for these three scripts
          since episode 5 and 6 were written in the 1980s while episode 7 was
          written in the 2010s. So not only time period changed, but also parent
          companies that helped make the movies. So I decided to do a simple
          word count analysis to see if there were any differences in the
          scripts. I did how many times a character was mentioned in the script:

            Luke remains a central character in Empire and Jedi, but takes a
            more peripheral role in The Force Awakens, mirroring his absence for
            most of the film.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            Han's mentions decrease from Empire to Jedi and then further in The
            Force Awakens, possibly reflecting his diminished role as the focus
            shifts to new characters.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            Leia's mentions decline slightly across the three films, with a
            notable decrease in The Force Awakens as the story focuses more on
            Rey and Finn, and perhaps her real life

            Vader maintains a significant presence in Empire and Jedi, while his

            with the second highest number of mentions.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            New protagonists Rey and Finn are heavily featured in The Force

            The Emperor emerges as a key character in Jedi, while Supreme Leader
