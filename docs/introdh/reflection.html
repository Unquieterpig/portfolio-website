        <h2>What are the most significant challenges for a new learner?</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          The biggest challenge for new learners when developing a website is
          understanding the syntax and structure of HTML and CSS. Beginners also
          have to overcome the thought that what you write in code will be what
          it looks like in the browser. This is not always the case, and it can
          be frustrating for new learners.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What advantages do you associate with one method over the other?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          The advantages of coding a hand built website is that there is more
          freedoms avaliable to the developer. You literally shape the website
          to whatever you want it to be. There is some beauty in that.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What challenges are there for modifying the layout and organization of
          each site?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Having to look up every HTML and CSS tag and attribute to understand
          what it does can be very cumbersome. It is also difficult to remember
          each and every one. Also having an unorganized CSS style sheet can
          make debugging and modifying the layout and organization of the site
          very difficult.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What skills are necessary to learn and develop these sites in either
          format?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          An understanding in how HTML and CSS interact with each other is
          necessary to develop websites by hand. Also, an understanding of how
          to use a text editor and how to use a web browser is necessary. A
          basic understanding of how to use a web browser's developer tools is
          also needed for an easier time to debug and customize your website.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What skills do you think you want to learn to improve on this website?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Me personally would love to learn how to use JavaScript to make my
          website more interative. I would also like to convert this website to
          a React website that utilizes NextJS. So I can hook it up to a
          database that would pull my latest projects into my projects page.
